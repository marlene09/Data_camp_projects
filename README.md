# Data_camp_projects

This project combines image processing/augmentation techniques on images of bees prior to applying deep learning models to predict bee species. 

In this project, I used libraries such as Pillow, numpy , matplotlib to load and augment images, thereafter I used deep learning approaches to identify 
and predict different bee species.
